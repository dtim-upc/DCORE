# TODO

- [ ] Benchmark execution time
  - [ ] `Benchmark0Query1` file should be generated: one for each complexity, #workers, query
- [ ] Test outputs are the one expected for each strategy 
  - startup should accept a callback.
  - ScalaTestAsync receives this callback and completes the future.
- [ ] Sequential strategy: only 1 worker
- [ ] Read paper about double hashing and implement it
