  abstract="We study the enumeration complexity of the natural extension of acyclic conjunctive queries with disequalities. In this language, a number of NP-complete problems can be expressed. We first improve a previous result of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis by proving that such queries can be computed in time {\$}c.|{\backslash}cal M|.|{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}cal M)|{\$}where {\$}{\backslash}cal M{\$}is the structure, {\$}{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}cal M){\$}is the result set of the query and c is a simple exponential in the size of the formula ϕ. A consequence of our method is that, in the general case, tuples of such queries can be enumerated with a linear delay between two tuples.",

abstract = {Events play many roles in computer systems, ranging from hardware interrupts, over event-based software architecture, to monitoring and managing of complex systems. In many applications, however, individual event occurrences are not the main point of concern, but rather the occurrences of certain event patterns. Such event patterns can be defined by means of an event algebra, i.e., expressions representing the patterns of interest are built from simple events and operators such as disjunction, sequence, etc. We propose a novel event algebra with intuitive operators (a claim which is supported by a number of algebraic properties). We also present an efficient detection algorithm that correctly detects any expression with bounded memory, which makes this algebra particularly suitable for resource-constrained applications such as embedded systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that executes complex event queries over real-time streams of RFID readings encoded as events. These complex event queries filter and correlate events to match specific patterns, and transform the relevant events into new composite events for the use of external monitoring applications. Stream-based execution of these queries enables time-critical actions to be taken in environments such as supply chain management, surveillance and facility management, healthcare, etc. We first propose a complex event language that significantly extends existing event languages to meet the needs of a range of RFID-enabled monitoring applications. We then describe a query plan-based approach to efficiently implementing this language. Our approach uses native operators to efficiently handle query-defined sequences, which are a key component of complex event processing, and pipeline such sequences to subsequent operators that are built by leveraging relational techniques. We also develop a large suite of optimization techniques to address challenges such as large sliding windows and intermediate result sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a detailed performance analysis of our prototype implementation under a range of data and query workloads as well as through a comparison to a state-of-the-art stream processor.},
