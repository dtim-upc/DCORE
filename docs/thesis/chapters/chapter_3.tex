\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{chapter:preliminaries}

In this section, we introduce the formal background that support our study.
First, we introduce the concepts behind \emph{distributed computing}.
Secondly, we describe CEQL and give a formal description.
Thirdly, we briefly discuss \emph{selection strategies}.
Lastly, we introduce the computational model CEA.

\section{Distributed computing}\label{sec:distributed_computing}

A \emph{distributed system} is a system whose components are located on different networked computers that communicate to each other by message passing in order to achieve a common goal. The main three characteristics of a distributed system are: concurrency of the components, lack of global memory and clock, and tolerance to failure of individual components \cite{distributed-computing-book}. Nowadays, the term is used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by exchanging messages. In our work, we do not make a distinction on whether the system operates on a cluster of networked computers or in a single multi-core computer.

A \emph{distributed program} is composed of an ordered-set of $n$ asynchronous processes $\mathcal{P} = \{ P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n}\}$. For a process $P_{i}$ with $1 \le i \le n$, define its \emph{index}, denoted index($P_{i}$), as index($P_{i}$) = $i \in \mathbb{N}$. The index of a process can be used as a \emph{unique} identifier. The processes do not share a global memory and communicate solely by passing messages. Process execution and message transfer are asynchronous. Without loss of generality, we assume that each process is running on a different processor. Let $C_{ij}$ denote the channel from process $P_{i}$ to process $P_{j}$ and let $m_{ij}$ denote a message sent by $P_{i}$ to $P_{j}$. The message transmission delay is finite and unpredictable \cite{distributed-computing-book}.

\section{Data-tuples, complex events, predicates, and valuations}\label{sec:ceql}

\textbf{Data-tuples.} A \emph{data-tuple} $t := \textbf{A} \to \textbf{D}$ is the function that maps attribute names to data values, where \textbf{A} is the set of all \emph{attribute names} (e.g., $id$, and $val$) and \textbf{D} is the set of all \emph{data values} (e.g., integer values, string values, etc.). Data-tuples are associated to an \emph{event type} \textbf{T} (e.g., \code{H} and \code{T}).

\textbf{Complex events.} A \emph{complex event} is a pair $C = ([i,j], D)$ where $i \le j \in \mathbb{N}$ and $D$ is a subset of $\{i, \ldots, j\}$. Given a possibly infinite stream $S = t_{0}t_{1}\ldots$, the time interval $[i, j]$ corresponds to the lower and upper bound where the complex event $C$ happens in the stream $S$, and $D$ represents the position of the events in the stream $S$ that constitute the complex event $D$. We write $C(data)$ to denote $D$, and $C(time)$ to denote the time-interval $[i, j]$.

\textbf{Valuations.} A \emph{valuation} is a pair $V = ([i, j], \mu)$ with $[i,j]$ a time interval as above and $\mu$ a partial function that assigns subsets of $\{i, \ldots, j\}$ to variables in \textbf{X}, where \textbf{X} is a fixed set of \emph{variables} s.t. $\textbf{T} \subseteq \textbf{X}$. We write $V(time)$ for $[i,j]$, and $V(X)$ for the subset of $\{i,\ldots, j\}$ assigned to X by $\mu$. We write $C_{V}$ for the complex event that is obtained from valuation $V$: $C_{V}(time) = V(time)$ and $C_{V}(data) = \bigcup\limits_{X \in \textbf{X}} V(X)$.

\textbf{Predicates.} A \emph{predicate} represents a property or a relation of a set of data-tuples. A \emph{unary} predicate is a predicate that represents properties of individual data-tuples. A data-tuple $t$ \emph{satisfies} predicate $P$, denote $t \Vdash P$, iff $t \in P$. Furthermore, a set of data-tuples $T$ satisfies $P$, denoted by $T \Vdash P$, iff $\displaystyle\mathop{\forall}_{t \in T} t \vDash P$.

\section{Complex Event Logic}\label{sec:ceql}

\emph{Complex Event Query Language (CEQL)} \cite{core} is a CER query language based on \emph{Complex Event Logic (CEL)} \cite{formal-framework-cep}. We introduce the most relevant features of CEQL by means of an example.

\begin{example}
We retake the previous example on the detection of fires in a stream produced by a network of wireless sensors placed in a warehouse. Suppose that we are interested in all $n$-tuples of \code{T} events where the first has temperature below $30$ Celsius degrees and the rest has temperature above $30$ Celsius degrees, partitioned by the zone of the warehouse where the sensor is placed. The query from Figure~\ref{fig:query:2} expresses this in CEQL.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=120pt, linenos=false, fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
    SELECT *
    FROM warehouse
    WHERE (T as t1; T+ as ts)
    FILTER t1[val < 30]
      AND ts[val > 30]
    PARTITION BY id
    WITHIN 5 minutes
  \end{minted}
  \caption{CEQL query on a wireless sensors network stream.}
  \label{fig:query:2}
\end{figure}

The \code{SELECT} clause allows to project the matches complex event. In our query, the \code{*} operator retrieves all events in the complex event. The \code{FROM} clause indicates the input streams (e.g., \code{warehouse}). The \code{WHERE} clause indicates the pattern of the complex event to capture in \emph{unary} CEL. In our query, the pattern \code{T as t1; T+ as ts} indicates that we want to capture all complex events that consist of an event type \code{T} followed by an arbitrary number of events of type \code{T}. We remark that events do not need to be contiguous under the default policy \emph{skip-till-any-match}. The \code{FILTER} clause allows to filter events by predicates. The clause \code{PARTITION BY} allows to partition the events using equi-joins. In our query, we partition the events by sensors that belong to the same zone of the warehouse. The \code{WITHIN} clause specifies the time window. In our query, the time between the first event \code{T} and the last event \code{T} must be within 5 minutes.
\end{example}

\newpage

Next, we give the formal syntax and semantics of CEQL.

\textbf{Syntax.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=0pt, linenos=false, fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
    SELECT        (selection strategy)? <list of variables>
    FROM          <list of streams>
    WHERE         CEL formula
    (PARTITION BY <list of attributes>)?
    (WHITHIN      time window)?
  \end{minted}
\end{figure}

\vspace{-30pt}

The \code{WHERE} clause expects a pattern written in \emph{Complex Event Logic (CEL)} \cite{formal-framework-cep}. CEL is a formal logic built on top of the common operators of the literature of CER, whose abstract syntax is represented by the following grammar:

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{equation*}
  \varphi := R    \ | \ \varphi \ \text{AS} \ X    \ | \    \varphi \ \text{FILTER} \ X[P]  \ | \   \varphi \ \text{OR} \ \varphi   \ | \  \varphi ; \varphi    \ | \  \varphi+ \ | \ \pi_{L}(\varphi).
\end{equation*}

\vspace{-10pt}
In this grammar, $R$ is an event type in \textbf{T}, $X$ is a variable in \textbf{X}, $P$ is a predicate, and $L$ is a subset of variables in \textbf{X}. We remark that CEL includes \code{FILTER}, and so CEQL does not need a separate \code{FILTER} clause.

\textbf{Semantics.} The evaluation of a CEQL is as follows. First, we evaluate the \code{FROM} clause that specifies the list of streams. If more than one stream is specified, the evaluation algorithm will merge them into a single stream $S$. Then, we (optionally) evaluate clause \code{PARTITION BY}, which partitions stream $S$ into multiple substreams and evaluates clauses \code{WHERE, SELECT, WITHIN} on each substream in that order. Note that the evaluation of each substream could be executed in parallel. The semantics of \code{WHERE-SELECT} clauses is derived from the semantics of CEL in Figure~\ref{fig:cel:semantics}. A CEL formula $\varphi$ evaluates to a set of valuations, denoted $\InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$. Specifically,

\begin{itemize}
  \item $R$.\quad  Evaluates to the valuation $\InSBrackets{R}(S)$ whose time interval and data is a single event $R$ at position $i$ in stream $S$.
  \item $\varphi \ \text{AS} \ X$.\quad Corresponds to a variable assignment. It extends a valuation $V \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$ by mapping $X \to \bigcup_{Y}V(Y)$.
  \item $\varphi \ \text{FILTER} \ X[P]$.\quad Evaluates to a valuation $([i, j], \mu) \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$ such that all variables $X \in \mu$ satisfy predicate $P$.
  \item $\varphi_{1} \ \text{OR} \ \varphi_{2}$.\quad Evaluates to the union of the valuations $\InSBrackets{\varphi_{1}}(S)$ and $\InSBrackets{\varphi_{2}}(S)$.
  \item $\varphi_{1} ; \varphi_{2}$.\quad Evaluates to all pairs of valuations such that the first element happens before the second element in the stream.
  \item $\varphi+$.\quad Evaluates to the union of one or more times of the valuation $\InSBrackets{\varphi(S)}$.
  \item $\pi_{L}(\varphi)$.\quad Evaluates to the valuation $\InSBrackets{\varphi(S)}$ such that all variables that are not in $L$ map to the empty set.
\end{itemize}

Note, \code{SELECT} clause corresponds to a projection in CEL. Finally, the (optional) clause \code{WITHIN} filters the set of valuations returned by the \code{WHERE-SELECT} clauses such that $\InSBrackets{\varphi \ \text{WITHIN} \ \epsilon}(S) = \{ V \in \InSBrackets{S} \ | \ V(end) - V(start) \le \epsilon \}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{align*}
    \InSBrackets{R}(S) &= \{V \ | \ V(time) = [i,i] \land t_{i}(type) = R\\
                       &\qquad\quad \land V(R) = {i} \land \forall X \ne R. V(X) = \emptyset \}\\
    \InSBrackets{\varphi \ \text{AS} \ X}(S) &= \{V \ | \ \exists V' \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S). V(time) = V'(time)\\
                       &\qquad\quad \land V(X) = \cup_{Y} V'(Y)\\
                       &\qquad\quad \land \forall Z \ne X. V(Z) = V'(Z)\}\\
    \InSBrackets{\varphi \ \text{FILTER} \ X[P]}(S) &= \{V \ | \ V \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S) \land V(X) \vDash P \}\\
    \InSBrackets{\varphi_{1} \ \text{OR} \ \varphi_{2}}(S) &= \InSBrackets{\varphi_{1}}(S) \cup \InSBrackets{\varphi_{2}}(S)\\
    \InSBrackets{\varphi_{1} \ ; \ \varphi_{2}}(S) &= \{V \ | \ \exists V_{1} \in \InSBrackets{\varphi_{1}}(S), V_{1} \in \InSBrackets{\varphi_{2}}(S).\\
                       &\qquad\quad  V_{1}(end) = V_{2}(start)\\
                       &\qquad\quad \land V(time) = [V_{1}(start), V_{2}(end)]\\
                       &\qquad\quad \land \forall X. V(X) = V_{1}(X) \cup V_{2}(X) \}\\
    \InSBrackets{\varphi+}(S) &= \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S) \cup \InSBrackets{\varphi;\varphi+}(S)\\
    \InSBrackets{\pi_{L}(\varphi)}(S) &= \{ V \ | \ \exists V' \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S). V(time) = V'(time)\\
                              &\qquad\quad \forall X \in L. V(X) = V'(X) \\
                              &\qquad\quad \forall X \notin L. V(X) = \emptyset \}
  \end{align*}
  \caption{The semantics of CEL.}
  \label{fig:cel:semantics}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Complex event semantics}. Recall that CER systems operate under complex event semantics. However, above we defined CEQL semantics in terms of valuations. We can recover complex events semantics by forgetting the variables in the valuations. That is, if $\varphi$ is a CEL formula, its complex event semantics $\InDBrackets{\varphi}(S)$ is defined as $\InDBrackets{\varphi}(S) := \{ C_{V} \ | \ V \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)\}$.

\section{Selection strategies}\label{sec:selection_strategies}

\emph{Selection strategies} (or \emph{selectors}) are unary operators over CEL formulas that restrict the set of results and speed up query processing. We present four selection strategies \cite{formal-framework-cep,formal-framework-cer}: \emph{strict} (\textsc{strict}), \emph{next} (\textsc{nxt}), \emph{last} (\textsc{last}) and \emph{max} (\textsc{max}). Next, we describe and formally specify selection strategy \textsc{max}, as it is relevant in our work, and refer the interested reader to \cite{formal-framework-cer} for a definition and discussion of the other selection strategies. For the sake of the discussion, we will define the \emph{support} of a valuation $V$ as the set of all positions appearing in the range of $V$, i.e., $sup(V) = \bigcup\limits_{X \in \textbf{X}}V(X)$.

\textsc{MAX}. This selection strategy keeps the maximal complex events in terms of set inclusion, which could be naturally more useful because these complex events are the \emph{most informative}. Formally, given a CEL formula $\varphi$ we say that $V \in \InSBrackets{\textsc{max}(\varphi)}(S)$ holds iff $V \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$ and for all $V' \in \InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$, if $sup(V) \subseteq sup(V')$, then $sup(V) = sup(V')$ (i.e., $V$ is maximal with respect to set containment). For example, given a CEL query $\varphi$, if $\InSBrackets{\varphi}(S)$ returns $\{ 1,2,4\}$, $\{1,3,4\}$, and $\{1,2,3,4\}$. Then, $\textsc{max}(\varphi)$ will only return $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}$, which is the maximal complex event.

\section{Computational model}\label{sec:cea}

% TODO
As explained in Section~\ref{sec:ceql}, evaluating a CEQL query corresponds to evaluating the query's \code{SELECT-WHERE-WITHIN} clauses on either a single stream, or multiple different substreams. In our work, the \code{SELECT-WHERE} part of a query is compiled into a \emph{Complex Event Automaton} \cite{formal-framework-cep,formal-framework-cer}, which is a form of finite automaton that produces complex events. Our evaluation algorithm is then defined in terms of CEA: it takes as input a CEA $\mathcal{A}$, the time-window $\epsilon$ specified in the \code{WITHIN} clause, and a stream $S$, and uses this to compute $\InDBrackets{\varphi}(S)$. Formally, a \emph{Complex Event Automaton (CEA)} is a tuple $\mathcal{A} = (Q, \Delta, q_{0}, F)$ where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $\Delta \subseteq Q \times \textbf{P} \times \{\bullet, \circ\} \times (Q \setminus \{ q_{0} \})$ is a finite transition, $q_{0} \in Q$ is the initial state, and $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states. We will denote transitions in $\Delta$ by $q \xrightarrow[]{P/m} q'$. A \emph{run} of $\mathcal{A}$ over stream $S$ from positions $i$ to $j$ is a sequence $\rho := q_{i} \xrightarrow[]{P_{i}/m_{i}} q_{i+1} \xrightarrow[]{P_{i+1}/m_{i+1}} \ldots \xrightarrow[]{P_{j}/m_{j}} q_{j+1}$ such that $q_{i}$ is the initial state of $\mathcal{A}$ and for every $k \in [i,j]$ it holds that $q_{k} \xrightarrow[]{P_{k}/m_{k}} q_{k+1} \in \Delta$ and $t_{k} \vDash P_{k}$. A run $\rho$ is \emph{accepting} if $q_{j+1} \in F$. An accepting run of $\mathcal{A}$ over $S$ from $i$ to $j$ naturally defines the complex event $C_{\rho} := ([i, j], \{ k \ | \ i \le k \le j \land m_{k} = \bullet \})$. Finally, we define the semantics of $\mathcal{A}$ over a stream $S$ as $\InDBrackets{\mathcal{A}}(S) := \{ C_{\rho} \ | \ \rho \text{ is an accepting run of } \mathcal{A} \text{ over } S\}$.

  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{A CEA representing the query from Figure~\ref{fig:query:2} and an example of stream.}
  \label{fig:cea}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
  In Figure~\ref{fig:cea} we show the compilation of the query from Figure~\ref{fig:query:2} into an equivalent CEA $\mathcal{A}$. We depict predicates by listing, in array notation, the event type, and the constraint on the temperature attribute. The initial state is $q_{1}$ and there is only one final state: $q_{4}$. The figure also includes an example stream $S$, where the values correspond to the event type, the identifier attribute, and the temperature attribute, in that order.
\end{example}

The usefulness of CEA comes from the fact that CEL can be translated into CEA \cite{formal-framework-cep,formal-framework-cer}. Because the \code{SELECT-WHERE} part of a CEQL query is in essence a CEL formula, this reduces the evaluation problem of the \code{SELECT-WHERE-WITHIN} part of CEQL query into the evaluation problem for CEA.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem~1 \cite{core}]\label{theorem:cea}
  For every CEL formula $\varphi$ we can construct a CEA $\mathcal{A}$ of size linear in $\varphi$ such that for every $\epsilon$:
  \begin{equation*}
    \InDBrackets{\varphi \code{ WITHIN } \epsilon}(S) = \{ C \ | \ C \in \InDBrackets{\mathcal{A}}(S) \land C(end) - C(start) \le \epsilon \}
  \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

Our evaluation algorithm will compute the right-hand side of this equation. It requires that the input CEA $\mathcal{A}$ is \emph{I/O deterministic}: for every pair of transitions $q \xrightarrow[]{P_{1}/m_{1}} q_{1}$ and $q \xrightarrow[]{P_{2}/m_{2}} q_{2}$ from the state $q$, if $P_{1} \cap P_{2} \ne \emptyset$ then $m_{1} \ne m_{2}$. To put it another way, an event $t$ may trigger both transitions at the same time only if one transition marks the event, but the other does not. In \cite{formal-framework-cep,formal-framework-cer}, it was shown that any CEA can be I/O-determinized, with a possibly exponential blow-up in the size of the automaton.

\section{Chapter summary}

In this chapter we have presented the preliminary work that is required for our work. First, we introduced the concept of distributed computing. Then, we described the syntax and semantics of CEQL and CEL. Afterwards, we presented the selection strategies, and explained the semantics of \textsc{max}. Finally, we introduced the computational model CEA, which is used to evaluate CEQL.
