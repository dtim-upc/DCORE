\chapter{Conclusions and future work}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We presented a novel distributed CER framework that focuses on the efficient evaluation of a large class of complex event queries, including $n$-ary predicates. We proposed two implementations based on such framework: DCERE and DCORE. In particular, DCORE uses a novel evaluation algorithm that tackles the super-linear complexity of non-unary predicates and the exponential complexity of the enumeration. Furthermore, our experiments results show that our framework is practical and outperforms its competitors on queries with complex predicates over large streams of data.

We plan to continue our research in a few directions. We will extend our framework with a generic rewrite and refine algorithm. We are also preparing an extension of the distributed evaluation algorithm that takes into account time windows during the distribution phase. Finally, we will explorer the correlation capabilities offered register and data automata, and the aggregation capabilities of cost register automata.
