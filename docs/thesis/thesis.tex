\acknowledgements{%
  I have so many people to thank.

  First, and foremost, I am grateful to my advisor Sergi Nadal for his enthusiasm and guidance. This thesis would have not been possible without him. Second, I am due to my co-advisor Stijn Vansummeren. His insightful remarks and suggestions have made some of the contributions of this thesis possible.

  Thanks to Marco Bucchi, Alejandro Grez, Andre\'es Quintana, and Cristian Riveros, among many others, for their numerous contributions to the field of complex event recognition that made this work possible.

  I owe a debt of gratitude to my colleague and friend, Juan Pablo Royo. He is the reason I started this master's degree after three years away from the academia.

  I cannot express enough gratitude toward my family, old and new, who have supported me in every possible way during these two harsh years of pandemic. To my parents. They have supported me during the span of this master's degree. They are both remarkable parents and I am very lucky to be their son. To my brother Adri\`a. He is the best brother someone could ask for.

  I am left to thank my couple Marta. She has been with me every step on the way. No words can truly express how I feel: I love you and thank you.
